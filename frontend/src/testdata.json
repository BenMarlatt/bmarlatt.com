				"data": "The current iteration of my portfolio website is built on a robust React front-end, coupled with a FastAPI backend working to connect with the MySQL database. This entire setup is housed on DigitalOcean's App Platorm. GitHub provides reliable version control and facilitates my CI/CD processes, streamlining development. However, I plan on future changes. I'm eyeing a migration to a more versatile Go language as a backend, which excites me as it offers a new learning experience. Along with this, I'm considering alternative CI/CD pipelines for an even smoother developmental workflow. "
